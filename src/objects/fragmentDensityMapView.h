    /* By default, the fragment density map is locked by the host
       for reading between vkCmdBeginRenderPass during recording and
       VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_FRAGMENT_DENSITY_PROCESS_BIT_EXT during draw
       execution. This can introduce large latency for certain use
       cases between recording the frame and displaying the frame.
       Apps may wish to modify the fragment density map just before
       draw execution.

       If VK_IMAGE_VIEW_CREATE_FRAGMENT_DENSITY_MAP_DYNAMIC_BIT_EXT
       is used, then the application can modify the image until the
       device reads it during VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_FRAGMENT_DENSITY_PROCESS_BIT_EXT.

       VK_IMAGE_VIEW_CREATE_FRAGMENT_DENSITY_MAP_DEFERRED_BIT_EXT is
       intended to help address this for implementations that do not
       support the fragmentDensityMapDynamic feature by deferring
       the start of the locked range to vkEndCommandBuffer. */
